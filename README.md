# Search-a-Book

## Description:
This Google Books search engine is built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. As a user you can create an account, search for books and save those books to a personal list. Each book has a link directly to Google for you to purchase the book. If you become uninterested in a book on your list you can remove that book.
